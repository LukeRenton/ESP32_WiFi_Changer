# ESP32_WiFi_changer
Application that provides an interface to switch between which network the ESP32 chip can join

This project uses the LED light changing project (as seen here: https://lastminuteengineers.com/creating-esp32-web-server-arduino-ide/) as a base. I added functionality where you can select which network you would like to connect the ESP32 device to.
